<div class="all"><h2>The term 'handmade' usually refers to objects made by hand or by using simple tools rather
than machines. The result may be homely — as in a child's clay ashtray — or exquisite — as in
a pair of bespoke brogues.</h2>
I evoke the term 'handmade web' to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by
software; web pages made and maintained by individuals rather than by businesses or
corporations; web pages which are provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages
which challenge conventions of reading, writing, design, ownership, privacy, security, or
identity. Handmade web pages flourished in the mid-to-late-1990s, in the brief period after the academic
web and before the corporate web. ‘Handmade’ is by no means the only or best term to define
the web of this period.

<p>In her essay, <a href="https://art.teleportacia.org/observation/vernacular/">A Vernacular Web (2005)</a> Olia Lialina describes the web of the mid-1990s as:
bright, rich, personal, slow and under construction. It was a web of sudden connections and
personal links. Pages were built on the edge of tomorrow, full of hope for a faster connection
and a more powerful computer... it was a web of amateurs soon to be washed away by dot.com
ambitions, professional authoring tools and guidelines designed by usability experts.For more information on Olia Lialina and Dragan Espenschied's excellent research on the
amateur web, see: <a href="https://blog.geocities.institute/about">One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age: Digging through the Geocities Torrent.</a></p>

    <p><h2>I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to make a correlation between handmade web
pages and handmade print materials, such as zines, pamphlets, and artists books.</h2>
I made my first web-based work in 1995. The impetus for <a href="https://luckysoap.com/butterflies/parasite.html">Fishes & Flying Things</a> came from the
material practices of fine art and book-making. The text evolved from an installation art
exhibition I had on at the time. From this text, I created a small book-work which was meant to
tell a circular story but when people got to the end they stopped reading because that’s the way
books work. In the web version, the last page linked to the first; the story circled round and
round. Of the installation, no physical evidence remains. Of the book-work, only one copy. The
QuarkExpress file is stored on a 44 MB SyQuest cartridge which I still own, but the contents of
which I can no longer access. The handmade website, on the other hand, is still online and it still
works.
<p>The handmade web emerged at a time when print and digital enjoyed a more symbiotic
relationship. This is evident in the early output of the trAce Online Writing Centre founded at
Nottingham Trent University in 1995. Over the next decade trAce evolved into one of the most
influential online writing communities in the world. trAce’s first output was a word-processed
photocopied booklet which contained links to websites distributing journals and zines. Fittingly,
trAce’s last output was also a print booklet, in which it is stated:
The trAce community embraced both camps, and some early chatlogs contain lively discussions
about the use of mixed media in writing... The creative hypertexts and hypermedia in the trAce
Archive can easily be compared to the multifarious pages of an artist’s book. (PDF trAces: A
Commemoration of Ten Years of Artistic Innovation at trAce, page 14)
One of the many interesting things about the online archive of the trAce Online Writing Centre is
how much it reflects the context of the creation and dissemination of its contents. Whereas
archives held in museums or libraries generally contain artifacts created elsewhere —
manuscripts illuminated in a monastery, for example, or photographs developed in a darkroom
— the handmade web pages contained in this online archive continue to exist in the medium
within which they were created. That said, the frames through which we view them continue to
change.</p>

In "Media Archaeology: Method and Machine versus History and Narrative of Media" (2011)
Wolfgang Ernst observes: "If a radio from a museum collection is reactivated to play broadcast
channels of the present, it changes its status: it is not a historical object anymore but actively
generates sensual and informational presence." Similarly, when viewing old web pages in

modern browsers we are confronted with a temporal paradox. Layer upon layer of dated web-
design aesthetics overlap and peel like wallpaper, revealing earlier versions beneath. Pages

optimised for lower resolutions now take less than a third of the screen. Ghosts of browsers past
mingle with occasional page errors, dead links, and missing images. Sound files play
automatically. Warnings abound, issued from earlier eras, addressed to readers who are not us.
For example, M.D. Coverley’s The Personalization of Complexity (2001) "explores the ways in
which each of our personal computers have become idiosyncratic, individualized entities, only
sometimes manageable by the owners." Fittingly, the piece itself warns that it is viewable only
on Level 4 and 5 Microsoft Internet Explorer and Level 4 Netscape. Netscape 6 will not support
many of the features in this essay.
These are not artifacts of a dead web but rather, signposts on a map of a living web pointing to a
web as it once was, a web in progress, a web in the making.

<h2>I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to advocate for an ongoing active engagement
with the making of web pages and of web policies.</h2>
In The Web We Lost (2012), Anil Dash writes: "In the early days of the social web, there was a
broad expectation that regular people might own their own identities by having their own
websites, instead of being dependent on a few big sites to host their online identity."
In February 2015 the online journal QUARTZ published an article with the provocative
headline: Millions of Facebook users have no idea they’re using the internet. As the article
states: "This is more than a matter of semantics. The expectations and behaviors of the next
billion people to come online will have profound effects on how the internet evolves."
<p>In October 2014 the online journal GIZMODO published an article heralding The Great Web 1.0
Revival. Its author Kyle Chayka observed:
The booming size of today's mainstream social networks and the constant level of noise we
have to deal with has inspired a sudden return to a time when the internet was quieter, safer,
and more intimate... We're nostalgic for the close-knit, DIY nature of the early web, where
everything was smaller...</p>
<p>The DIY aesthetics and practices of the mid-1990s have been embraced by the anti-social
network TILDE.CLUB, which hosts a small community of users on a single unix computer. For
some, TILDE.CLUB serves as a platform for revisiting amateur web aesthetics in a
contemporary context. For example, on her page, Olia Lialina invites users to view a new net art
work 640x480 - a 4-tab browser installation. For many others however, TILDE.CLUB has served
as little more than a hip territory to occupy. Many pages remain blank. <a href="http://tilde.club/~nickc/ http://tilde.club/~bwalker/ http://tilde.club/~willy/">http://tilde.club/~nickc/ http://tilde.club/~bwalker/ http://tilde.club/~willy/</a></p>


In other corners of the internet, Web 1.0 aesthetics have never disappeared. My own website,
including this page, which uses fixed-width table cells, is based on a template I created in
HomeSite in 1997.
Web 1.0 aesthetics persist in source code and stated objectives of the massive Ubu Web site,
an "independent resource dedicated to all strains of the avant-garde, ethnopoetics, and outsider
arts." On 16 December 2014, the founder of boasted on Twitter that "the whole damn site is still
hand-coded in html 1.0 in bbedit, from templates made in 1996."
I shall put off updating my website templates until out-of-date design is no longer cool.
